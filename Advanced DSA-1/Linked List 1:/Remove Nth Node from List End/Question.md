Problem Description

Given a linked list A, remove the B-th node from the end of the list and return its head.
For example, given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and B = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.

NOTE: If B is greater than the size of the list, remove the first node of the list.

Try doing it using constant additional space.

Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 106

Input Format

The first argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the linked list. The second argument of input contains the integer B.

Output Format

Return the head of the linked list after deleting the B-th element from the end.

Example Input

Input 1:
A = 1->2->3->4->5
B = 2
Input 2:
A = 1
B = 1

Example Output

Output 1:
1->2->3->5
Output 2:

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
In the first example, 4 is the second last element.
Explanation 2:
In the second example, 1 is the first and the last element.
